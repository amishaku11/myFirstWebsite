        <img src="imagess/trex.jpeg" alt="the Tyrannosaurus Rex">
        <div class="hovertext1"> Known as the <b>King of the Dinosaurs</b>, the Tyrannosaurus Rex was one of the most powerful predators to ever walk the planet. <br>
         It lived about <b>68 to 66 million years ago</b> during the Late Cretaceous period. <br>
         With a massive skull, sharp teeth, and strong legs, it could crush bones and run surprisingly fast for its size. <br>
         The T-Rex became world-famous through movies like <b>Jurassic Park</b>.</div>
    </div>
    <br>
       
    <h3 class="famous1">II. Triceratops</h3>
    <div class="hoverimage2">
        <img src="imagess/triceptops.jpeg" alt="Triceratops">
        <div class="hovertext2"> The <b>Triceratops</b> was a plant-eating dinosaur known for its large frill and three sharp facial horns. <br>
         It lived around <b>68 million years ago</b> in North America. <br>
         Its horns were used to defend against predators like T-Rex. <br>
         Despite its tough look, it was a peaceful herbivore that moved in herds.

    <div class="hovertext3">
         The <b>Velociraptor</b> was a small, fast, and intelligent predator. <br>
         It was about the size of a turkey but had deadly claws and hunted in packs. <br>
         It lived around <b>75 million years ago</b> during the Late Cretaceous period. <br>
         Real Velociraptors had feathers, unlike their movie versions!

    <div class="hovertext4">The <b>Brachiosaurus</b> was one of the tallest dinosaurs ever discovered. <br>
        It had long front legs and a long neck that allowed it to eat leaves from tall trees. <br>
         This gentle giant lived about <b>154 million years ago</b>. <br>
         It could reach up to 40 feet in height — almost as tall as a four-storey building!

    <div class="hoverimage5">
        <img src="imagess/Stegosaurus.jpeg" alt="Stegosaurus">
        <div class="hovertext5"> The <b>Stegosaurus</b> is recognized by the two rows of large, bony plates along its back. <br>
         It lived about <b>150 million years ago</b> in the Late Jurassic period. <br>
         Despite its size, it had a very small brain—about the size of a walnut! <br>
         Its spiked tail, called the “thagomizer,” was its main weapon.

         It lived around <b>100 million years ago</b> and could swim. <br>
        Its long snout and sharp teeth helped it catch fish. <br>
         Scientists consider it the <b>largest known carnivorous dinosaur</b>. </div></div><BR>
