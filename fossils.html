    <h1> Dinosaur Fossils</h1>

    <p>
        Fossils are the preserved remains or traces of ancient life. They are like time capsules, 
        helping scientists understand what dinosaurs looked like, how they lived, and how the Earth has changed over millions of years.
    </p>

    <h3 class="fossil">What Are Dinosaur Fossils?</h3>
    <img src="imagess/fosil.jpeg" alt="Dinosaur Fossil" width="400">
    <p>
        1. Dinosaur fossils include bones, teeth, eggs, and sometimes even skin impressions. <br>
        2. Fossils are formed when a dinosaur dies and is buried under layers of mud and sand. Over time, minerals replace the organic material, turning it into stone. <br>
        3. Fossils provide crucial evidence about extinct species, their size, diet, and even behavior.
    </p>

    <h3 class="fossil">Famous Fossil Discoveries</h3>
    <p>
        1. <b>Archaeopteryx:</b> A fossil showing the link between dinosaurs and birds. <br>
        2. <b>Sue the T-Rex:</b> One of the most complete Tyrannosaurus Rex skeletons ever found. <br>
        3. <b>Velociraptor with feathers:</b> Shows that some dinosaurs had feathers, not scales.
    </p>

    <h3 class="fossil">How Fossils Are Studied</h3>
    <p>
        1. Paleontologists carefully excavate fossils from rock layers. <br>
        2. They use tools like brushes, chisels, and scanners to examine the bones. <br>
        3. Fossils can also be displayed in museums or used for 3D scanning and reconstruction to bring dinosaurs “back to life.”
    </p>

    <h2> Importance of Fossils</h2>
    <p>
        Fossils are not just rocks—they are windows into the distant past. 
        They help scientists reconstruct the history of life, understand evolution, and learn how ancient ecosystems functioned. 
        Without fossils, dinosaurs would remain a complete mystery!
