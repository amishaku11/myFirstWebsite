      <h1>More About Them</h1>
      <h3>1. Theropods</h3>
      <p>
        Theropods were primarily bipedal carnivores that walked on two legs. Famous species include <strong>Tyrannosaurus rex</strong> and <strong>Velociraptor</strong>. They had sharp teeth, powerful claws, and keen eyesight, making them excellent hunters. Some smaller species had feathers, linking them to modern birds. They could hunt alone or in packs, depending on the species, and were highly adaptable.

      <h3>2. Sauropodomorphs</h3>
      <p>
        Sauropodomorphs were massive, long-necked herbivores, including giants like <strong>Brachiosaurus</strong> and <strong>Diplodocus</strong>. Their long necks and tails allowed them to reach tall trees and wide areas for feeding. They had pillar-like legs and hollow bones to support their enormous bodies. These dinosaurs often moved in small groups for protection, and their slow metabolism required large amounts of vegetation daily.

      <h3>3. Thyreophorans (Armored Dinosaurs)</h3>
      <p>
        Thyreophorans were herbivorous dinosaurs with heavy body armor for protection. <strong>Stegosaurus</strong> had plates along its back for thermoregulation and display, while <strong>Ankylosaurus</strong> had a clubbed tail to fend off predators. They were slow-moving and relied on armor and social grouping for protection. They fed mainly on low-lying plants and had strong jaws for chewing tough vegetation.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Ornithopods (Herd Herbivores)</h3>
      <p>
        Ornithopods could walk on two or four legs. Famous species include <strong>Iguanodon</strong> and <strong>Parasaurolophus</strong>. They lived in herds for safety and protection and had specialized teeth to grind tough plant material. Some species had crests or beaks used for communication or mating displays.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Ceratopsians (Horned Dinosaurs)</h3>
      <p>
        Ceratopsians were herbivorous dinosaurs with horns and frills on their heads. Species include <strong>Triceratops</strong> and <strong>Protoceratops</strong>. Horns were used for defense, combat, and display. They often lived in herds and relied on social behavior for survival. Their frills helped protect the neck and may have regulated body temperature.

      <h3>6. Pachycephalosaurs (Thick-Headed Dinosaurs)</h3>
      <p>
        Pachycephalosaurs were bipedal herbivores or omnivores. Examples include <strong>Pachycephalosaurus</strong> and <strong>Stegoceras</strong>. They had thick, domed skulls used for head-butting contests. Strong legs allowed them to run quickly. Their teeth were adapted for chewing plants, and they had keen eyesight and hearing.
      </p>

      <h3>7. Heterodontosaurs</h3>
      <p>
        Heterodontosaurs were small early herbivores or omnivores. They had different types of teeth to eat plants and insects. They were fast and agile, helping escape predators. Examples include <strong>Heterodontosaurus</strong>. They provide insight into the early evolution of ornithischians.

      <!-- 3. Conclusion -->
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Dinosaurs were one of the most diverse groups of animals in Earth's history. From giant long-necked herbivores to fast predators, armored giants, and social herd species, each type evolved unique traits to survive. Studying these dinosaurs helps us understand life during the Mesozoic Era and the incredible diversity of prehistoric life.
